"""strands-transformers type extensions.

The upstream Strands / harness-sdk message schema models text, image, video,
document, tool-use and tool-result content blocks — but has NO audio content
block. Audio-native conversational models (Qwen2-Audio, Qwen2.5-Omni) consume
audio *inside the conversation*, so we extend the taxonomy here with an
`audio` content block and route it through the model provider.
